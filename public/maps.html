			<h2>About the maps</h2>
			<hr/>
			<p>A question that's often asked is: "Can you recommend me a good map to play with HD?" The answer is: "Sure we can!"</p>
			<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> The difficulty ratings here are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate. Your mileage may vary depending on which mods you are playing with or how good you are at shooting demons.</p>
			<p><b>Contributing:</b> If you wish to submit a map to this list, please do the following:
				<ol>
					<li>Take a clean screenshot of an area that you find fancy-looking or interesting. To do clean screenshots, hide the HUD and use "r_drawplayersprites 0" in the console to hide the weapon.</li>
					<li>Write a short description.</li>
					<li>Send both to Accensus on the HD Discord, along the difficulty section the map should be in.</li>

				<h3>Kuchitsu</h3>
				<h5>by Memfis</h5>
				<hr/>
				<p class="description">Six urban-themed maps that serve as an ideal starting point for new players. A good variety of scenarios that utilize all the non-boss Doom 2 enemies. Hot starting points on Map03 and Map05, but nothing too extreme.</p>

				<h3>Revolution!</h3>
				<h5>by Thomas van der Velden</h5>
				<hr/>
				<p class="description">Lots of small-scale encounters in mostly realistic environments, well-suited for people new to HD. Much of the difficulty is frontloaded in the earlier maps, with maps 03 and 06 requiring particularly cautious play. There's just a couple problem encounters for the rest of the WAD after that, but nothing too serious. Use the tools you're given, look for secrets if you need to, and everything should be fine.</p>

				<h5>by Arvell/Arvy</h5>
				<hr/>
				<div class="recommended">Community highlight</div>
				<p class="description">Short but intricate and beautiful map inspired by Deus Ex. Technical gunfights in realistic spaces, and plenty of opportunity to avoid traps, approach fights from multiple directions, or attack enemies on your own terms (note that bullets can go through windows). The main sticking point is the mastermind fight, which mostly involves tediously peeking in and out of the elevator instead of using the open rooftop space.</p>

				<p class="description">A quaint, relaxing megawad with just a couple problem maps. There's a bit more long-range combat and platforming than usual, but it's also very generous with supplies.</p>

				<h5>by Erik Alm</h5>
				<hr/>
				<p class="description">The first 22 maps are manageable, short and small encounters that even a new player shouldn't have a hard time with. From Map23 on, expect a massive difficulty spike. Map28 will require the use of berserk to reach the exit in time.</p>

				<h3>Ashes 2063: Sterilised Edition</h3>
				<h5>by Vostyok</h5>
				<hr/>
				<p class="description">Immersive, atmospheric, and beautiful post-apocalyptic mapset in the style of STALKER and Metro 2033. The Sanitized Edition is slightly buggy but works for the most part with HD. Provides a good mix of semi-linearity and exploration, combined with intense battles in realistic tactical spaces. Pairs well with DarkDoomZ and Ugly as Sin for balancing the gameplay towards scavenging and stealth. May require <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/426102657577386004/557593015582195719/AshesHDBarrelfix.pk3">AshesHDBarrelfix.pk3</a> if flaming barrels appear to "flicker" their offsets.</p>

				<h3>Doom II The Way id Did</h3>
				<h5>by the TWiD team</h5>
				<p class="description">A series of original maps, patterned after the styles of id's own mappers. Encounters are generally on the easier side, with particularly gentle Archvile usage, but the platforming in some levels will require advanced tricks. Do not go to the second secret map, it will softlock due to a DEHACKED enemy being overwritten by HD. The first secret map is fully playable, just take the normal exit.</p>

				<h3>Hatomo Battles The Yomi Demons</h3>
				<h5>by Tobias MÃ¼nch & Pablo Dictter</h5>

				<h3>Dimension of the Boomed</h3>
				<h5>by Urthar</h5>
				<p class="description">A surprisingly convincing set of Quake 1-styled maps. Along with some custom monsters borrowed from the source material, it also replaces most vanilla monsters without significant behavior changes. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ytme2u9bkmqunc2/DOTB_HDPatch.pk3?dl=1">Here</a> is a patch to overwrite them with HD monsters again. A rocket launcher is highly recommended. At the very least, pick one up before Map06.</p>

				<h3>Bury My Heart Knee Deep</h3>
				<h5>by Ryath</h5>
				<p class="description">Basically an entire E1-themed episode crammed into a single map, with a ton of interconnectivity and optional areas. The early game is fairly comfortable, but by the end the encounters ramp up significantly, introducing Doom 2 monsters and some nasty ambushes. Less persistent players should skip the red key, and anyone sane should skip the yellow key. Bringing a loadout with a lightamp, radsuit, and backpack would also ease the journey considerably, since it'll be a long time before you gain access to any of them in the map.</p>

				<h3>Doom 64: Consolation Prize</h3>
				<h5>by Nevander & Kinsie</h5>
				<p class="description">Midway's crack at doom on a console. Unlike most other such attempts, they chose not to simply port the existing levels from PC, but to make their own along with new textures. This specific version is Nevander's Doom 64: Retribution, edited by Kinsie for compatibility with gameplay altering mods.</p>
				<p class="description">These maps have a moderate difficulty progression and love to utilize close-range ambushes. Mercifully, Midway decided not to include the Arch-Vile in doom 64 for space reasons, so none of them here. On the other hand they did put in a lot of Hell Knights and Barons of hell, and their new scripting tools allowed them to make more complicated traps than was previously possible.</p>

				<h3>Back to Saturn X Episode 1: Get Out Of My Stations</h3>
				<h5>by Esselfortium et al.</h5>
				<p class="description">A respectably tough mapset even by vanilla standards, turned appropriately hopeless by HD's vicious roster. You're not here to kill all the demons - merely surviving will be hard enough. Plan your approaches, use your tools, and remember that discretion is the better part of valor, and you might just make it.</p>
